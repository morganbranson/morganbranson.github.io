   <h2 style="color:palevioletred;text-align: center;">Personal Reflection:</h2>
 
   <p> Reflecting on my many jobs I am overall thankful for all of them. They have all 
   shaped me into the person I am today, and I benefited from each of them. As I move 
   on to my professional career, I hope to use all the skills learned from school and 
   work to ensure that I am successful. </p>
   
  <h4 style="color:palevioletred;">Gildehaus Construction</h4>
   <p> When I think back on my time working as an office assistant, I can really say that
   this position gave me a strong understanding of how closely related administrative
   work and on-site operations are. It included more than just paperwork; it involved
   actively participating in the projects, serving as a trustworthy link in the chain
   of events, and realizing the value of accuracy and efficiency in the construction
   sector. </p>
  
   <h4 style="color:palevioletred;">New Haven Municipal Pool</h4>
   <p>It's clear to me now that my job as a lifeguard involved more than simply keeping
   people safeâ€”it also involved building a community in which everyone felt safe,
   taken care of, and free to enjoy their time at the pool. This experience has
   improved my practical skills and taught me the value of hard effort, empathy,
   and collaboration in any professional environment.</p>
   
   <h4 style="color:palevioletred">Adam Puchta Winery</h4>
   <p>My job as a Tasting Room Bartender has helped me come out of my shell. Growing up
   I have always been sort of shy, but this job has put me in situations that have
   pushed me out of my comfort zone. I have really enjoyed this job and am grateful
   for the opportunities it has opened up for me. I continue to help out here on the
   weekends because I love the atmosphere and meeting new people.</p>
