     Hello, my name is Morgan Branson. I’m from New Haven Missouri, which is in wine country! A German area of Missouri with many wineries. I am a senior at Mizzou and will be graduating in May 2024. I earned an Associate’s Degree in 2021 from East Central College, I chose to go here after high school. I was unsure of what I wanted to major in. This was during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. So staying closer to home was a better option. When I graduate in May, I will have an Interdisciplinary Studies Degree, with an emphasis in Architecture, Marketing, and Psychology. I will also have a Business Minor. I work part-time at a winery in Herman, MO. I enjoy this job because it has a great atmosphere and great co-workers. After graduation, I plan on finding a full-time job as well as helping at the winery on weekends during the busy seasons as well. I do not have the most experience with web development. However, I'm excited to learn and use it in my future. In my freetime I enjoy spending time with friends, going to the gym, and making any kind of art!
