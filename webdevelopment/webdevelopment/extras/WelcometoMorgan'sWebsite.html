               <title>Welcome to Morgan's Website!</title>

     Hello, my name is Morgan Branson. I’m from New Haven Missouri, which is in wine country! A German area of Missouri. I am a senior at Mizzou and will be graduating in May 2024. I earned an Associate’s Degree in 2021 from East Central College. I chose to go here after high school. I was unsure of what I wanted to major in. This was during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. So staying closer to home was a better option. When I graduate in May, I will have an Interdisciplinary Studies Degree. With an emphasis in Architecture, Marketing, and Psychology. I will also have a Business Minor. I work part-time at a winery in Herman, MO. I enjoy this job because it has a great atmosphere and great co-workers. After graduation, I plan on finding a full-time job. I plan on helping at the winery on weekends during the busy seasons as well.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18pt;">This webpage is to help you test uploading, viewing, and editing while using your IDE setup.</p>
    
<p>In this code, you will find a few different HTML tags and elements that we will discuss more in Week 2.</p>
    <p style="color:chocolate;">You can do <span style="font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"> a great many things</span> with <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: deeppink;">only HTML and CSS alone</span>, such as changing the <em>color</em> of this font. And even changing the <span style="font-family: cursive; color:blueviolet;"> type of font presented!</span></p>
    <p>We can change any number of things, much like a Word Processor:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Font Type</li>
        <li>Font Weight</li>
        <li>Font Size</li>
        <li>Font Color</li>
        <li>Font Emphasis (underline, italics, etc.)</li>
        <li>Text Alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Now you try! </p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20pt;"> Replace this text with a sentence of your own and re-save the file.</p>
