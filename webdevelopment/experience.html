        <div class="Gildehaus">    
    <h4 style="color:palevioletred;">Gildehaus Construction</h4>
    <p>During my time of going to East Central College, I also worked for Gildehaus Construction, a local 
    company in New Haven. I worked with Gildehaus Construction from September 2020 to August 2021. Here 
    I was considered as an office assistant. This job taught me a lot about behind-the-scenes in 
    construction and the business part of it. I had many different responsibilities working for this 
    company.  Most regularly, I would organize customer files, prepare bills for subcontractors, and 
    prepare customers’ invoices. Occasionally, I would have errands to do in town, which ranged anywhere
     from doing returns at Lowes, delivering supplies to job sites, and delivering employee paychecks.</p> 
    This job was beneficial for my understanding of the business. I had the opportunity to meet new people and 
    enhance my organizational skills. </div>

    <div class="Lifeguard">
    <h4 style="color:palevioletred;">New Haven Municipal Pool</h4>
    <p>I worked as a diligent lifeguard during the summers of the years 2018, 2019, and 2021 at the New Haven
    Municipal Pool in New Haven, Missouri. Participated in frequent in-services to improve abilities, kept
    a close eye on assigned pool areas, gave visitors safety and happiness priority, and collaborated with 
    a group of coworkers. Each summer we would be audited a few times without our knowing and would have to
    perform a save. I was audited once each year and passed with exceeds each time. However, I couldn’t
    have passed without my team of co-workers. I also performed three real-life saves. This was stressful
    in the moment but greatly rewarding. This experience made me more adept at handling stressful 
    circumstances and reinforced the value of cooperation and open communication in a fast-paced setting.</p>

    <div class="AdamPuchta> 
    <h4 style="color:palevioletred">Adam Puchta Winery</h4>
   <p></p> Since June 2023, I have been a Tasting Room Bartender at the Adam Puchta Winery in Herman, Missouri, 
    and I have played a vital role in providing our visitors with an outstanding experience. Serving wine 
    tastings and interacting with customers by telling them about the winery's rich history and variety of
    flavors is one of the main responsibilities.</p></div>
