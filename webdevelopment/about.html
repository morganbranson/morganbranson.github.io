    <p>As a <em>senior</em> at the <b>University of Missouri</b>—also referred to as Mizzou—my name is Morgan Branson.<br> I made this platform in the hopes that potential employers would look around and learn more about who I am.<br> This website is a thorough resource that offers details about my educational background, work experiences, and range of abilities that make me an excellent prospect. As I draw closer to finishing my <em>undergraduate</em> degree. </p>
