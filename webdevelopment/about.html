<p>I plan to graduate with a <em>Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies</em> 
    with a specialization in Architecture, Marketing, and Psychology from the <b>University of Missouri</b> in May 2024.
    To round off this, I'll have earned a <em>minor in business</em>.
    In order to add even more real-world experience to my Mizzou education, I worked part-time at the Adam Puchta Winery in Herman, Missouri.
    <br>I started my academic career in 2020 at East Central College in Union, Missouri, where I graduated with an Associates’ Degree the following year in 2021. 
    This formative experience prepared me for my pursuit of a University of Missouri comprehensive education. 
    My studies at Mizzou are multidisciplinary, combining psychology, marketing, and architecture, which represents my dedication to a comprehensive understanding of several subjects.
    I was born and raised in New Haven, Missouri, where I also finished my high school and primary schooling. 
    My commitment to academics was matched by my active participation in a variety of sports and groups during middle and high school. 
    I graduated in 2020 and placed in the top 10 of my class. My involvement in sports, such as basketball, track and field, and volleyball, has developed a strong sense of discipline, perseverance, and collaboration. 
    My participation in extracurricular organizations like Student Council, Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America, Future Business Leaders of America, and Fellowship of Christian Athletes has also helped me to develop a wide range of skills, from organizational and leadership skills to a dedication to community service.</p>
