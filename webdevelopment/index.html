<h3 style="text-align: center;">Greetings and thanks for visiting my page! </h3>
As a senior at the University of Missouri—also referred to as Mizzou—my name is Morgan Branson.
I made this platform in the hopes that potential employers would look around and learn more about who I am. 
This website is a thorough resource that offers details about my educational background, work experiences, and range of abilities that make me an excellent prospect. 
As I draw closer to finishing my undergraduate degree.
